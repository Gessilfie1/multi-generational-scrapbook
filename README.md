# Milestones #
A multi-generational scrapbook application

Description:
An application that connects multi-generational family members using a simple interface to share photos and statuses. Family members who are less tech-savvy can easily view images and milestones of the children they care about, without the clutter and complexity seen in other social media platforms today.
